<p><span class="dcap">t was</span> April, a couple
of weeks before the
Derby. We were playing
poker, which is a
game of skill that has
nothing to do with the velocity of
horse meat.</p>

<p>Phil Howland kept slipping open
but he managed to close up before I
could tell whether the combination of
Three-Five-Two-Four meant a full
house of fives over fours or whether
he was betting on an open-ended
straight that he hadn't bothered to
arrange in order as he held them.
The Greek was impenetrable; he also
blocked me from reading the deck
so that I could estimate his hand from
the cards that weren't dealt out. Chicago
Charlie's mind was easy to read
but no one could trust him. He was
just as apt to think high to score someone
out as he was to think low to
suck the boys in. As for me, there
I was, good old Wally Wilson, holding
a pat straight flush from the eight
to the queen of diamonds. I was
thinking "full house" but I was betting
like a weak three of a kind.</p>

<p>It was a terrific game. Between trying
to read into these other guy's
brains and keeping them from opening
mine, and blocking the Greek's
sly stunt of tipping over the poker
chips as a distraction, I was also concerned
about the eight thousand bucks
that was in the pot. The trouble was
that all four of us fully intended to
rake it in. My straight flush would be
good for the works in any normal
game with wild cards, but the way
this bunch was betting I couldn't be
sure. Phil Howland didn't have much
of a shield but he could really read,
and if he read me&mdash;either my mind
or my hand&mdash;he'd automatically
radiate and that would be that.</p>

<p>I was about at the point of calling
for the draw when the door opened
without any knock. It was Tomboy
Taylor. We'd been so engrossed with
one another that none of us had
caught her approach.</p>

<p>The Greek looked up at her and
swore something that he hadn't read
in Plato. "Showdown," he said, tossing
in his hand.</p>

<p>I grunted and spread my five
beauties.</p>

<p>Phil growled and shoved the pot
in my direction, keeping both eyes
on Tomboy Taylor.</p>

<p>She was something to keep eyes on,
both figuratively and literally. The
only thing that kept her from being a
thionite dream was the Pittsburgh
stogie that she insisted upon smoking,
and the only thing that kept her from
being some man's companion in spite
of the stogie was the fact that he'd
have to keep his mouth shut or she'd
steal his back teeth&mdash;if not for
fillings, then for practice.</p>

<p>"You, Wally Wilson," she said
around the cigar, "get these grifters
out of here. I got words."</p>

<p>The Greek growled. "Who says?"</p>

<p>"Barcelona says."</p>

<p>I do not have to explain who Barcelona
is. All I have to say is that
Phil Howland, The Greek, and Chicago
Charlie arose without a word
and filed out with their minds all
held tight behind solid shields.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I said, "What does Barcelona want
with me?"</p>

<p>Tomboy Taylor removed the stogie
and said evenly, "Barcelona wants to
see it Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and
Lady Grace next month."</p>

<p>When I got done gulping I said,
"You mean Barcelona wants me to
fix the Kentucky Derby?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," she replied in a very
throaty contralto that went with her
figure and her thousand dollars worth
of simple skirt and blouse. "You
needn't 'Fix' anything. Just be sure
that it's Flying Heels, Moonbeam,
and Lady Grace in that order. One,
two, three. Do I make Barcelona quite
clear?"</p>

<p>I said, "Look, Tomboy, neither of
them platers can even <i>run</i> that far,
let alone running ahead."</p>

<p>"Barcelona says they can. And
will." She leaned forward and
stubbed out the Pittsburgh stogie and
in the gesture she became wholly
beautiful as well as beautifully wholesome.
As she leaned toward me she
unfogged the lighter surface of her
mind and let me dig the faintly-leaking
concept that she considered
me physically attractive. This did not
offend me. To the contrary it pleased
my ego mightily until Tomboy Taylor
deliberately let the barrier down
to let me read the visual impression&mdash;which
included all of the implications
contained in the old clich&eacute;:
"... And don't he look nacheral?"</p>

<p>"How," I asked on the recoil, "can
I fix the Derby?"</p>

<p>"Barcelona says you know more
about the horse racing business than
any other big time operator in Chicago,"
she said smoothly. "Barcelona
says that he doesn't know anything
about horse racing at all, but he has
great faith in your ability. Barcelona
says that if anybody can make it Flying
Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady
Grace, one, two, and three, Wally
Wilson is the man who can do it.
In fact, Barcelona will be terribly
disappointed if you can't."</p>

<p>I eyed her carefully. She was a
composed and poised beauty who
looked entirely incapable of uttering
such words. I tried to peer into her
mind but it was like trying to read
the fine print of a telephone directory
through a knitted woolen shawl. She
smiled at me, her shapely lips curving
graciously.</p>

<p>I said, "Barcelona seems to have
a lot of confidence in my ability to
arrange things."</p>

<p>With those delicate lips still curved
sweetly, she said, "Barcelona is willing
to bet money on your ability as
a manager."</p>

<p>At this point Tomboy Taylor fished
another Pittsburgh stogie out of her
hundred dollar handbag, bit off the
end with a quick nibble of even, pearly-white
teeth, and stuffed the cigar
in between the arched lips. She
scratched a big kitchen match on the
seat of her skirt after raising one
shapely thigh to stretch the cloth.
She puffed the stogie into light and
became transformed from a beauty
into a hag. My mind swore; it was
like painting a mustache on the Mona
Lisa.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of her mouth
she replied to my unspoken question:
"It helps to keep grippers like you
at mind's length."</p>

<p>Then she left me alone with my
littered card table and the eight
thousand buck final pot&mdash;<i>and</i> the
unhappy recollection that Barcelona
had gotten upset at something Harold
Grimmer had done, and he'd gone
into Grimmer's place and busted
Grimmer flat by starting with one
lousy buck and letting it ride through
eighteen straight passes. This feat of
skill was performed under the mental
noses of about eight operators trained
to exert their extrasensory talents toward
the defeat of sharpshooters who
tried to add paraphysics to the laws
of chance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lieutenant Delancey of the Chicago
police came in an hour later. He refused
my offer of a drink, and a
smoke, and then because I didn't
wave him to a chair he crossed my
living room briskly and eased himself
into my favorite chair. I think
I could have won the waiting game
but the prize wasn't good enough to
interest me in playing. So I said,
"O.K., lieutenant, what am I supposed
to be guilty of?"</p>

<p>His smile was veiled. "You're not
guilty of anything, so far as I know."</p>

<p>"You're not here to pass the time
of day."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I want information."</p>

<p>"What kind of information?"</p>

<p>"One hears things," he said
vaguely.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," I said, "you've been
watching one of those halluscene
whodunit dramas where everybody
stands around making witty sayings
composed of disconnected phrases.
You'll next be saying 'Evil Lurks In
The Minds Of Men,' in a sepulchral
intonation. Let's skip it, huh? What
kind of things does one hear and
from whom?"</p>

<p>"It starts with Gimpy Gordon."</p>

<p>"Whose mind meanders."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Gimpy Gordon's
meandering mind is well understood
for what it is," he said. "But when
it ceases to meander long enough to
follow a single train of thought from
beginning to logical end, then something
is up."</p>

<p>"Such as what, for instance."</p>

<p>The lieutenant leaned back in my
easy-chair and stared at the ceiling.
"Wally," he said, "I was relaxing
in the car with Sergeant Holliday
driving. We passed a certain area on
Michigan near Randolph and I caught
the strong mental impression of someone
who&mdash;in this day and age,
mind you&mdash;had had the temerity to
pickpocket a wallet containing twenty-seven
dollars. The sum of twenty-seven
dollars was connected with the
fact that the rewards made the risk
worth taking; there were distinct impressions
of playing that twenty-seven
bucks across the board on three
very especial nags at the Derby. The
impression of the twenty-seven bucks
changed into a mental vision of a
hand holding a sack of peanuts. There
was indecision. Should he take more
risk and run up his available cash to
make a larger killing, or would one
Joseph Barcelona take a stand-offish
attitude if some outsider were to lower
the track odds by betting a bundle
on Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and
Lady Grace."</p>

<p>I said, "Lieutenant, you've a pickpocket
to jug. Horse betting is legal."</p>

<p>"Since wagering on the speed of
a horse has been redefined as 'The
purchase of one corporate share to
be valid for one transaction only and
redeemable at a par value to be
established by the outcome of this
aforesaid single transaction,' horse
betting is legal. This makes you an
'Investment Counselor, short-term
transactions only,' and removes from
you the odious nomenclature of
'Bookie.' However, permit me to
point out that the buying and selling
of shares of horseflesh does not grant
a license to manipulate the outcome."</p>

<p>"You sound as though you're accusing
me of contemplating a fix."</p>

<p>"Oh no. Not that."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"Wally, Flying Heels, Moonbeam,
and Lady Grace were refused by the
National Association Of Dog Food
Canners because of their substandard
health. If I'm not mistaken, the Derby
Association should have to run the
race early that Saturday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Early?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. Early. Y'see, Wally, the
blue laws of the blue grass state make
it illegal to run horseraces on Sunday,
hence the start of the Derby
must be early enough to let our three
platers complete the race before midnight."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, there still stands a
mathematical probability that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That the rest of the field will
catch the Martian Glanders as they
lead our three dogs past the clubhouse
turn?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, you are wronging
me."</p>

<p>"I haven't said a thing."</p>

<p>"Then why have you come here
to bedevil me, lieutenant? If Barcelona
has ideas of arranging a
fix&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Barcelona has such notions,
Wally Wilson would know about
it."</p>

<p>"Everybody," I said, "entertains
notions of cleaning up a bundle by
having the hundred-to-one shot come
in by a length. Even Barcelona must
have wild dreams now and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come off it," he snapped. "Something's
up and I want to know what's
cooking."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Lieutenant, you're now asking me
to describe to you how someone might
rig the Kentucky Derby in a world
full of expert telepaths and perceptives
and manipulators, a large number
of which will be rather well-paid
to lend their extrasensory power to
the process of keeping the Derby
pure."</p>

<p>He eyed me sourly. "Remember,
'Fireman' O'Leary?"</p>

<p>"That's an unfair allegation," I
replied. "The rumor that he started
the Chicago Fire is absolutely unfounded."</p>

<p>"As I recall, 'Fireman' O'Leary
came by his nickname about one
hundred years after the holocaust
that started on DeKoven Street in
1871. It seems that 'Fireman' O'Leary
was most useful in helping the fillies
home at Washington Park by assaulting
them in the region of the bangtail
with small bollops of pure incandescence.
He was a pyrotic."</p>

<p>"That is a false accusation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was never proved," admitted
the lieutenant, "because any one who
accused anybody of making use of
extrasensory faculties in 1971 would
have been tossed into that establishment
out on Narragansett Avenue
where the headshrinkers once plied
their mystic trade."</p>

<p>"Things are different now."</p>

<p>"Indeed they are, Wally. Which is
why I'm here. No one but a fumbling
idiot would try anything as crude
as speeding a dog over the line by
pyrotics or by jolting the animals
with a bolt of electrical energy."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"So considering the sad and sorry
fact that human nature does not
change very much despite the vast
possibility for improvement, we must
anticipate a fix that has been contrived
and executed on a level that
takes full cognizance of the widespread
presence of psi-function."</p>

<p>"But again, why me?"</p>

<p>"Was not 'Fireman' O'Leary an
ancestor of yours?"</p>

<p>"He was my maternal grandparent."</p>

<p>"And so you do indeed come from
a long line of horse operators, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I resent your invidious implications."</p>

<p>"And wasn't 'Wireless' Wilson the
paternal ancestor from whom the
family name has come?"</p>

<p>"I fail to see ... the allegation that
my father's father employed telepathy
to transmit track information faster
than the wire services has never been
proved."</p>

<p>He smiled knowingly. "Wally," he
said slowly, "if you feel that allegations
have somehow impugned the
pure name of your family, you could
apply for a review of their several
appearances in court. It's possible that
'Fireman' O'Leary did <i>not</i> use his
pyrotic talent to enhance the running
speed of some tired old dogs."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I think we understand one
another, Wally. There is also reason
to believe that psionic talent tends
to run in families. You're a psi-man
and a good one."</p>

<p>"If I hear of anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll let me know," he said
flatly. "And if Flying Heels, Moonbeam,
<i>and-or</i> Lady Grace even so
much as succeed in staying on their
feet for the whole race, I'll be back
demanding to know how you&mdash;Wally
Wilson&mdash;managed to hold them up!"</p>

<p>After which the good Lieutenant
Delancey left me to my thoughts&mdash;which
were most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Barcelona had to be kept cheerful.
But the dogs he'd picked could only
come in first unassisted if they happened
to be leading the field that
started the <i>next</i> race, and even then
the post time would have to be delayed
to give them a longer head
start. That meant that <i>if</i> our three
platers came awake, <i>everybody</i> would
be looking for the fix.</p>

<p>Anybody who planned a caper
would sure have to plan it well.</p>

<p>Barcelona hadn't planned the fix,
he merely stated a firm desire and
either Barcelona got what he wanted
or I got what I didn't want, and I
had to do it real good or Delancey
would make it real hot for me.</p>

<p>I was not only being forced to
enter a life of crime, I was also being
forced to perform cleverly.</p>

<p>It wasn't fair for the law to gang
up with the crooks against me.</p>

<p>And so with a mind feeling sort
of like the famous sparrow who'd
gotten trapped for three hours in a
badminton game at Forest Hills, I
built a strong highball, and poured
it down while my halluscene set was
warming up. I needed the highball
as well as the relaxation, because
I knew that the "Drama" being
presented was the hundred and
umpty-umpth remake of "Tarzan of
the Apes" and for ninety solid minutes
I would be swinging through
trees without benefit of alcohol. Tarzan,
you'll remember, did not learn
to smoke and drink until the second
book.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The halluscene did relax me and
kept my mind from its worry even
though the drama was cast for kids
and therefore contained a maximum
of tree-swinging and ape-gymnastics
and a near dearth of Lady Jane's
pleasant company. What was irritating
was the traces of wrong aroma.
If one should not associate the African
jungle with the aroma of a cheap
bar, one should be forgiven for objecting
to Lady Jane with a strong
flavor of tobacco and cheap booze on
her breath.</p>

<p>And so I awoke with this irritating
conflict in my senses to discover that
I'd dropped out of my character as
Tarzan and my surroundings of the
jungle, but I'd somehow brought the
stench of cheap liquor and moist
cigarettes with me.</p>

<p>There was an occupant in the chair
next to mine. He needed a bath and
he needed a shave but both would
have been wasted if he couldn't
change his clothing, too. His name
was Gimpy Gordon.</p>

<p>I said, "Get out!"</p>

<p>He whined, "Mr. Wilson, you just
gotta help me."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Fer years," he said, "I been living
on peanuts. I been runnin' errands for
hard coins. I been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Swiping the take of a Red Cross
box," I snapped at him.</p>

<p>"Aw, Mr. Wilson," he whined,
"I simply gotta make a stake. I'm
a-goin' to send it back when I win."</p>

<p>"Are you going to win?"</p>

<p>"Can't I?"</p>

<p>For a moment I toyed with the
idea of being honest with the Gimp.
Somehow, someone should tell the
duffer that all horse players die broke,
or that if he could make a living
I'd be out of business.</p>

<p>Gimpy Gordon was one of Life's
Unfortunates. If it were to rain gold
coins, Gimpy would be out wearing
boxing gloves. His mental processes
meandered because of too much
methyl. His unfortunate nickname did
not come from the old-fashioned reason
that he walked with a limp, but
from the even more unfortunate
reason that he <i>thought</i> with a limp.
In his own unhealthy way he was&mdash;could
we call it "Lucky" by any
standard of honesty? In this world
full of highly developed psi talent,
the Gimp <i>could</i> pick a pocket and
get away with it because he often
literally could not remember where
and how he'd acquired the wallet for
longer than a half minute. And it
was a sort of general unwritten rule
that any citizen so utterly befogged
as to permit his wealth to be lifted
via light fingers should lose it as a
lesson!</p>

<p>But then it did indeed occur to me
that maybe I could make use of the
Gimp.</p>

<p>I said, "What can I do, Gimpy?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson," he pleaded, "is
it true that you're workin' for Barcelona?"</p>

<p>"Now, you know I can't answer
that."</p>

<p>I could read his mind struggling
with this concept. It was sort of like
trying to read a deck of Chinese
Fortune Cards being shuffled before
they're placed in the machine at the
Penny Arcade. As the drunk once
said after reading the Telephone Directory:
"Not much plot, but <i>egad</i>!
What a cast of characters!" The gist
of his mental maundering was a
childlike desire to have everything
sewed up tight. He wanted to win,
to be told that he'd win, and to have
all the rules altered ad hoc to assure
his winning.</p>

<p>Just where he'd picked up the inside
dope that Barcelona favored Flying
Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady
Grace in the Derby I could not dig
out of him. Just how Gimpy had
made the association between this
clambake and me&mdash;good old Wally
Wilson&mdash;I couldn't dig either. But
here he was with his&mdash;by now&mdash;sixty-five
bucks carefully heisted,
lifted, pinched and fingered, and by
the great Harry, Gimpy was not
a-goin' to lay it across the board on
those three rejects from a claiming
race unless he had a cast-iron assurance
that they'd come in across the
board, one, two, and three.</p>

<p>I said slowly, "<i>If</i> I were even
thinking of working for Mr. Barcelona,"
I told him, "I would be very
careful never, never to mention it,
you know."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This bundle of The Awful Truth
hit him and began to sink in with
the inexorable absorption of water
dropping down into a bucket of dry
sand. It took some time for the
process to climax. Once it reached
Home Base it took another period of
time for the information to be inspected,
sorted out, identified, analyzed,
and in a very limited degree,
understood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="521" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>He looked up at me. "I couldn't
cuff a hundred, could I?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. I didn't have to
veil my mind because I knew that
Gimpy was about as talented a telepath
as a tallow candle. Frankly between
me and thee, dear reader, I
do not put anybody's bet on the cuff.
I do a fair-to-middling brisk trade in
booking bets placed and discussed by
telepathy, but the ones I accept and
pay off on&mdash;if they're lucky&mdash;are
those folks who've been sufficiently
foresighted to lay it on the line
with a retainer against which their
losses can be assessed.</p>

<p>On the other hand I could see in
Gimpy's mind the simple logic that
told him that as a bookmaker I'd
be disinclined to lend him money
which he'd use to place with me
against a sure-thing long shot. If I
were to "Lend" him a century for
an on-the-cuff bet on a 100:1 horse,
especially one that I knew was sure
to come in, I might better simply
hand him one hundred times one
hundred dollars as a gift. It would
save a lot of messy bookkeeping.</p>

<p>So the fact that I wouldn't cuff
a bet for Gimpy gave him his own
proof that I was confirming the fix.</p>

<p>Then I buttered the process.</p>

<p>"Gimp, do you know another good
bookmaker?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But you're the best."</p>

<p>"Know one that'll take a bet from
you&mdash;one that you don't like?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Mr. Wilson."</p>

<p>"Then," I said hauling a thousand
out of my wallet, "Put this on <i>our
horses</i> for me."</p>

<p>He eyed the grand. "But won't
Mr. Barcelona be unhappy? Won't
that run down the track odds?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "The whole world
knows them dogs as also-rans," I
said. "Gimpy, they put long shots
like those into races just to clip the
suckers who think there is a real
hundred-to-one chance that a 100:1
horse will outrun favorites."</p>

<p>"Well, if you say so, Mr. Wilson."</p>

<p>"I say so."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll pay it back."</p>

<p>He would. I'd see to that.</p>

<p>Gimpy Gordon scuttled out of my
bailiwick almost on a dead run. He
was positively radiating merriment
and joy and excitement. The note
in his hand represented a sum greater
than he had ever seen in one piece
at any time of his life, and the concept
of the riches he would know
when they paid off on the Kentucky
Derby was vague simply because
Gimpy could not grasp the magnitude
of such magnificence. Oddly,
for some unexpected reason or from
some unknown source hidden deep
in his past, his mind pronounced it
"Darby."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I returned to my African jungle
still bored with the lack of anything
constructive. I returned at about the
point where Tarzan and Jane were
going through that silly, "Me Tarzan;
You Jane" routine which was
even more irritating because the program
director or someone had muffed
the perfume that the Lady Jane wore.
Instead of the wholesome freshness
of the free, open air, Jane was wearing
a heady, spicy scent engineered
to cut its way through the blocking
barrier of stale cigar smoke, whisky-laden
secondhand air, and a waft of
cooking aroma from the kitchen of
the standard cosmopolitan bistro.</p>

<p>Worse, it got worse instead of
better. Where a clever effects-director
might have started with the heavy
sophisticated scent and switched to
something lighter and airier as Jane
was moved away from civilization,
this one had done it backwards for
some absolutely ridiculous reason. It
finally got strong enough to distract
me out of my characterization, and
I came back to reality to realize once
more that reality had been strong
enough to cut into the concentration
level of a halluscene. There was
strong woman-presence in my room,
and as I looked around I found that
Tomboy Taylor had come in&mdash;just
as Gimpy Gordon had&mdash;and was
sitting in the other halluscene chair.
She was probably playing Lady Jane
to my Tarzan.</p>

<p>Tomboy Taylor had changed to a
short-skirted, low-necked cocktail
dress; relaxed with her eyes closed in
my halluscene chair she looked lovely.
She looked as vulnerable as a soft
kitten. Remembering that it's the soft
vulnerable ones that claw you if you
touch, I refrained.</p>

<p>I went to my little bar and refilled
my highball glass because
swinging through the jungle makes
one thirsty, and while I was pouring
I took a sly peek into Tomboy Taylor's
mind.</p>

<p>She was not halluscening. She was
watching me. And when I made contact
with her, she radiated a sort of
overall aura of amusement-emotion,
covered up her conscious deliberation,
and blocked any probing by directing
me mentally, "Make it two, Wally."</p>

<p>I built her one, handed it to her,
and then said, "Folks these days sure
have forgotten how to use doorbells."</p>

<p>"If you don't want people coming
in, Wally, you should restrict your
mindwarden a little. It's set to admit
anybody who does not approach the
door with vigorous intent to commit
grave physical harm. When the thing
radiates 'Come in and relax' is a girl
supposed to stand outside twiggling
on the doorbell?"</p>

<p>I dropped the subject thinking that
maybe I shouldn't have brought it up
in the first place. It's one that can't
be answered by logic, whereas a firm
emotional statement of like or dislike
stops all counter-argument and
I'd made the mistake of questioning
my own judgment.</p>

<p>So I eyed her and said, "Tomboy,
you did not come here to indulge in
small talk."</p>

<p>"No," she admitted. "I'm here to
keep track of you, Wally."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Our great and good friend wants
me to make notes on how clever you
are at arranging things."</p>

<p>"You mean Barcelona sent you."</p>

<p>"That's about it."</p>

<p>I looked at her askance. "And how
long are you going to stay?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Until Flying Heels,
Moonbeam, and Lady Grace come
across the finish line One, Two, and
Three at Churchill Downs on Derby
Day."</p>

<p>I grinned at her. "Considering that
trio of turtles, Tomboy, it may be for
years and it may be forever."</p>

<p>She held up her glass in a sort of
a toast. "Or," she said, "'Til death
do us part!"</p>

<p>A little bitterly I said, "One might
think that Barcelona doesn't trust
me."</p>

<p>She replied, "It isn't a matter of
trust. Barcelona holds you among his
very closest friends. He is well aware
of the fact that you would do anything
for him, that you prize his
friendship so highly yourself that you
would go to the most desperate
lengths to keep it firm and true. Yet
he realizes that the simple desire he
has recently expressed does place you
in a delicate mental attitude. You are
likely to feel that he shouldn't have
expressed this desire since you feel
obligated to fulfill it. He feels that
maybe this obligation to maintain
friendship at all costs may cause resentment.
Since Barcelona does not
want you to resent him, he sent me
to be your companion in the hope
that I might get some forewarning
should your friendship for him begin
to weaken."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Just why in this day and age she
didn't just come out and say&mdash;or
think&mdash;flatly that she was there to
keep me in line, I don't know. But
there she was, talking all around the
main point and delivering the information
by long-winded inference.</p>

<p>Even so, without her Pittsburgh
stogie, Tomboy Taylor was a mighty
attractive dish, and I knew that she
could also be a bright and interesting
conversationalist if she wanted to be.
Under other circumstances I might
have enjoyed the company, but it was
no pleasure to know that every grain
of her one hundred and fourteen
pounds avoirdupois was Barcelona's
Personal Property. At that moment
I realized that I was not too much
concerned with what Barcelona's reaction
might be. Instead, I was wishing
that things were different so
that any activity between us would
be for our own personal gain
and pleasure rather than the order
of or the fight against one Joseph
Barcelona. There was one consolation.
Tomboy Taylor had not come
equipped with a box of Pittsburgh
stogies with which to make my appreciation
of beauty throw up its
lunch.</p>

<p>She said, sweetly, "The better to
ensnare you, my dear."</p>

<p>But as she spoke, for just a moment
her thick woolly mind shield thinned
out enough for me to catch a strange,
puzzled grasp for understanding. As
if for the first time she had been
shown how admiration for physical
attractiveness could be both honest
and good. That my repugnant attitude
over her Pittsburgh stogies was not
so much based upon the spoiling of
beauty by the addition of ugliness,
but the fact that the act itself cheapened
her in my eyes.</p>

<p>Then she caught me peeking and
clamped down a mind screen that
made the old so-called "Iron Curtain"
resemble a rusty sieve.</p>

<p>"I'm the one that's supposed to
keep track of you, you remember,"
she said, once more covering up and
leaping mentally to the attack.</p>

<p>"I'll remember," I said. "But will
you tell me something?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said in a veiled attitude.</p>

<p>"Is your boy friend really interested
in cleaning up, or is he interested
in watching me squirm out of a
trap he set for me?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," she said, "I
may have been seen in Barcelona's
presence but please remember that
my association with Mr. Joseph Barcelona
has always been strictly on a
financial plane. This eliminates the
inference contained under the phrase
'Boy Friend.' Check?"</p>

<p>"O.K., Tomboy, if that's the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not only the way I want
it," she said, "but that's the way it
always has been and always will be.
Second, I have been getting tired of
this nickname 'Tomboy'. If we're going
to be racked this close together,
you'll grate on my nerves less if you
use my right name. It's just plain
'Nora' but I'd like to hear it once
in a while."</p>

<p>I nodded soberly. I held out a hand
but she put her empty highball glass
in it instead of her own little paw. I
shrugged and mixed and when I returned
and handed it to her I said,
"I'll make you a deal. I'll call you
'Nora' just so long as you maintain
the manners and attitude of a female,
feminine, lady-type woman. I'll treat
you like a woman, but you've got to
earn it. Is that a deal?"</p>

<p>She looked at me, her expression
shy and as defenseless as a bruiser-type
caught reading sentimental
poetry. I perceived that I had again
touched a sensitive spot by demanding
that she be more than physically
spectacular. Her defenses went down
and I saw that she really did not
know the answer to my question. I
did. It had to do with something
that only the achievement of a God-like
state&mdash;or extreme old age&mdash;would
change.</p>

<p>This time it was not so much the
answer to why little boys walk high
fences in front of little girls. It had
much more to do with the result of
what happens between little boys
when the little girl hides her baseball
bat and straightens the seams of her
stockings when one certain little boy
comes into sight. Joseph Barcelona
did not admire my ability. He had,
therefore, caused me to back myself
into a corner where I'd be taken down
a peg, shown-up as a second-rater&mdash;with
the little girl as a witness.</p>

<p>And why had Barcelona been so
brash as to send the little girl into
my company in order for her to witness
my downfall?</p>

<p>Let me tell you about Joe Barcelona.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Normally honest citizens often
complain that Barcelona is living high
off'n the hawg instead of slugging it
out in residence at Stateville, Joliet,
Illinois.</p>

<p>With their straight-line approach
to simple logic, these citizens argue
that the advent of telepathy should
have rendered the falsehood impossible,
and that perception should enable
anybody with half a talent to
uncover hidden evidence. Then since
Mr. Joseph Barcelona is obviously
not languishing in jail, it is patent
that the police are not making full
use of their talented extrasensory operators,
nor the evidence thus collected.</p>

<p>And then after having argued
thus, our upstanding citizen will fire
off a fast thought to his wife and ask
her to invite the neighbors over that
evening for a game of bridge.</p>

<p>None of these simple-type of logicians
seem to be aware of the rules
for bridge or poker that were in force
prior to extrasensory training courses.
Since no one recognized psionics, the
rules did not take telepathy, perception,
manipulation, into any consideration
whatsoever. Psionics hadn't
done away with anything including
the old shell game. All psionics had
done was to make the game of chance
into a game of skill, and made the
game of skill into a game of talent
that required better control and
longer training in order to gain full
proficiency.</p>

<p>In Barcelona's case, he had
achieved his own apparent immunity
by surrounding himself with a number
of hirelings who drew a handsome
salary for sitting around thinking
noisy thoughts. Noisy thoughts, jarring
thoughts, stunts like the concentration-interrupter
of playing the
first twenty notes of Brahms' Lullaby
in perfect pitch and timing and then
playing the twenty-first note in staccato
and a half-tone flat. Making
mental contact with Barcelona was
approximately the analogue of eavesdropping
upon the intimate cooing of
a lover sweet-talking his lady in the
middle of a sawmill working on an
order three days late under a high
priority and a penalty clause for delayed
delivery.</p>

<p>People who wonder how Barcelona
can think for himself with all of that
terrific mental racket going on do
not know that Barcelona is one of
those very rare birds who can really
concentrate to the whole exclusion
of any distraction short of a vigorous
threat to his physical well-being.</p>

<p>And so his trick of sending Nora
Taylor served a threefold purpose.
It indicated his contempt for me. It
removed Nora from his zone of interference
so that she could really
witness firsthand my mental squirmings
as I watched my own comeuppance
bearing down on me. It also
gave him double the telepathic contact
with me and my counter-plans&mdash;if
any.</p>

<p>In the latter, you see, Barcelona's
way of collecting outside information
was to order a temporary cease-fire of
the mental noise barrage and then
he'd sally forth like a one-man mental
commando raid to make a fast
grab for what he wanted. Since the
best of telepaths cannot read a
man's opinion of prunes when he's
thinking of peanuts, it is necessary
for someone to be thinking of the
subject he wants when he makes his
raid. Having two in the know and
interested doubled his chance for
success.</p>

<p>There was also the possibility that
Barcelona might consider his deliberate
"Leak" to Gimpy Gordon ineffective.
Most sensible folks are disinclined
to treat Gimpy's delusions
of grandeur seriously despite the truth
of the clich&eacute; that states that a one-to-one
correspondence does indeed exist
between the perception of smoke and
the existence of pyrotic activity. Nora
Taylor would add some certification
to the rumor. One thing simply had
to be: There must be no mistake
about placing information in Lieutenant
Delancey's hands so as to create
the other jaw of the pincers that
I was going to be forced to close
upon myself.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I tried a gentle poke in the general
direction of Barcelona and found
that the mental noise was too much
to stand. I withdrew just a bit and
closed down the opening until the
racket was no more than a mental
rumor, and I waited. I hunched that
Barcelona would be curious to know
how his contact-girl was making
out, and might be holding a cease-fire
early in this phase of the operation.
I was right.</p>

<p>The noise diminished with the
suddenness of turning off a mental
switch, and as it stopped I went in
and practically popped Barcelona on
the noodle with:</p>

<p>"How-de-do, Joseph."</p>

<p>He recoiled at the unexpected
thrust, but came back with: "Wally
Wilson! Got a minute?"</p>

<p>I looked at the calendar, counted
off the days to Derby Day in my
mind and told him that I had that
long&mdash;at the very least and probably
much, much longer.</p>

<p>"Thinks you!"</p>

<p>"Methinks," I replied.</p>

<p>"Wally boy," he returned, "you
aren't playing this very smart."</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell me how you'd
be playing it," I bounced back at
him. "Tell you how I have erred?"</p>

<p>He went vague on me. "If I were
of a suspicious nature, I would begin
to wonder about certain connective
events. For instance, let's hypothecate.
Let's say that a certain prominent
bookmaker had been suspected of
planning to put a fix on a certain important
horse race, but of course
nothing could be proved. Now from
another source we suddenly discover
strong evidence to suggest that this
bookmaker is not accepting wagers
on the horses he is backing, but conversely
is busy laying wagers on the
same nags through the help of a
rather inept go-between."</p>

<p>I grunted aloud which caused Nora
Taylor to look up in surprise. I was
tempted to say it aloud but I did not.
I thought:</p>

<p>"In simple terms, Joseph, you are
miffed because I will not cover your
bets."</p>

<p>"I thought nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Let's hedge? I love you too,
Joseph."</p>

<p>"Well, are you or aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Are I what? Going to top the
frosting by financing your little
scheme to put the pinch on me?"</p>

<p>"Now, Wally&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can it, Joseph. We're both big
boys now and we both know what
the score is. You know and I know
that the first time I or one of my boys
takes a bet on any one of the three
turtles you like, the guy who laid the
bet is going to slip the word to one
of your outside men. And you're going
to leap to the strange conclusion
that if Wally Wilson is accepting
bets against his own fix, he must
know something exceedingly interesting."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="600" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Now, who's been saying anything
about a fix, Wally?"</p>

<p>"The people," I thought bluntly,
"who have most recently been associated
with your clever kind of operator."</p>

<p>"That isn't very nice, Wally."</p>

<p>If it had been a telephone conversation,
I'd have slammed the telephone
on him. The mealymouthed louse
and his hypocritical gab was making
me mad&mdash;and I knew that he was
making me mad simply to make me
lose control of my blanket. I couldn't
stop it, so I let my anger out by
thinking:</p>

<p>"You think you are clever because
you're slipping through sly little loopholes,
Joseph. I'm going to show you
how neat it is to get everything I
want including your grudging admission
of defeat by the process of making
use of the laws and rules that
work in my favor."</p>

<p>"You're a wise guy," he hurled
back at me.</p>

<p>"I'm real clever, Barcelona. And
I'm big enough to face you, even
though Phil Howland, The Greek,
and Chicago Charlie make like cold
clams at the mention of your name."</p>

<p>"Why, you punk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go away, Barcelona. Go away
before I make up my mind to make
you eat it."</p>

<p>I turned to Nora Taylor and regarded
her charms and attractions
both physical and mental with open
and glowing admiration. It had the
precalculated result and it wouldn't
have been a whit different if I'd filed
a declaration of intent and forced
her to read it first.</p>

<p>It even satisfied my ambient curiosity
about what a telepathed grinding
of the teeth in frustrated anger
would transmit as. And when it managed
to occur to an unemployed
thought-center of my brain that the
lines of battle were soft and sweetly
curved indeed, Joseph Barcelona
couldn't stand it any more. He just
gave a mental sigh and signaled for
the noisemakers to shut him off from
contact.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Derby Day, the First Saturday in
May, dawned warm and clear with a
fast, dry track forecast for post time.
The doorbell woke me up and I
dredged my apartment to identify
Nora fiddling in my two-bit kitchen
with ham and eggs. Outside it was
Lieutenant Delancey practising kinematics
by pressing the button with a
levitated pencil instead of shoving on
the thing directly. (I'd changed the
combination on the mindwarden at
Nora's suggestion.)</p>

<p>As I struggled out of bed, Nora
flashed, "You get it, Wally," at me.
She was busy manipulating the ham
slicer and the coffee percolator and
floating more eggs from the refrigerator.
The invitation and the acceptance
for and of breakfast was still floating
in the mental atmosphere heavy
enough to smell the coffee.</p>

<p>I replied to both of them, "If he
can't get in, let him go hungry."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Delancey manipulated
the door after I'd reset the mindwarden
for him. He came in with a loud
verbal greeting that Nora answered
by a call from the kitchen. I couldn't
hear them because I was in the shower
by that time. However, I did ask,
"What gives, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"It's Derby Day."</p>

<p>"Yeah. So what?"</p>

<p>"Going to watch it from here?"
he thought incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why not? Be a big jam down
there."</p>

<p>"I've a box," he said.</p>

<p>"No ... how&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Both the Derby Association and
the Chicago Police Force have assigned
me to protect you from the
evil doings of sinners," he said with
a chuckle. "And I suggested that the
best way of keeping an official eye
on you was to visit you at the scene
of the alleged intended crime and to
serve that end they provided me with
a box where we can all be together."</p>

<p>I tossed, "And if we do not elect
to go to Kentucky?"</p>

<p>He chuckled again. "Then I shall
have to arrest you."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"There is an old law in the City
Statute that declares something called
'Massive Cohabitation' to be illegal.
You have been naughty, Wally."</p>

<p>Nora exploded. "We have not!"
she cried.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Delancey laughed like
a stage villain. "The law I mention,"
he said after a bit of belly-laughing,
"was passed long, long ago before
telepathy and perception were available
to provide the truth. At that
time the law took the stand that
any unmarried couple living together
would take advantage of their unchaperoned
freedom, and if this state
of cohabitation went on for a considerable
length of time&mdash;called
'Massive' but don't ask me to justify
the term&mdash;the probability of their
taking pleasure in one another's company
approached a one hundred per
cent positive probability.</p>

<p>"Now this law was never amended
by the Review Act. Hence the fact
that you have been chastely occupying
separate chambers has nothing to do
with the letter of the law that says
simply that it is not lawful for an unmarried
couple to live under the same
unchaperoned roof."</p>

<p>I came out of the shower toweling
myself and manipulating a selection
of clean clothing out of the closet
in my bedroom.</p>

<p>"The law," I observed, "is administered
by the <i>Intent</i> of the Law, and
not by the Letter, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," he said. "But I'm not
qualified to interpret the law. I'll
arrest you and bring you to trial and
then it's up to some judge to rule
upon your purity and innocence of
criminal intent, and freedom from
moral taint or turpitude. Maybe take
weeks, you know."</p>

<p>"And what's the alternative?" I
grunted.</p>

<p>"Flight," he said in a sinister
tone as I came out of my bedroom
putting the last finishes on my necktie.
"Flight away from the jurisdiction
of the law that proposes to warp
the meaning of the law to accomplish
its own ends."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"My duty," he grinned, "is to pursue
you."</p>

<p>"In which case," observed Nora
Taylor, "we might as well fly together
and save both time and money."</p>

<p>"That is why I have my personal
sky-buggy all ready to go instead of
requisitioning an official vehicle," he
said. He scooped a fork full of eggs
and said, "You're a fool, Wally. The
lady can cook."</p>

<p>I chuckled. "And what would happen
if I hauled off and married her?"</p>

<p>"You mean right here and now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sorry. I'd have to restrain you.
You see, you couldn't get a legal
license nor go through any of the
other legal activities, ergo there would
be a prima facie illegality about some
part of the ceremony. Without being
definite as to which phase, I would
find it my duty to restrain you from
indulging in any act the consummation
of which would be illegal."</p>

<p>Nora said in pseudo-petulant tone,
"I've been damned with very faint
praise."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Wally Wilson has just said that
he'd rather marry me than go to the
Kentucky Derby with you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Delancey said, "I urge
you both to come along. You see, my
box is also being occupied by an old
friend of yours. I managed to talk
him into joining us, and with reluctance
he consented."</p>

<p>"I'm a mind reader," I said. "Our
friend's name is Joseph Barcelona?"</p>

<p>"As they say on the space radio,
'Aye-firm, over and out!'"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Barcelona was there with two of his
boys. Watching them were four ununiformed
officers. Nora and I and the
lieutenant were joined later by Gimpy
Gordon, who might have been
radiating childlike wonder and a circus-air
of excitement at actually being
<i>at</i> the Derby. He might have been. No
one could cut through the constant,
maddening mental blah-blah-blah that
was being churned out by Barcelona's
noisemakers.</p>

<p>He greeted me curtly, eyed Nora
hungrily. He said: "You look pretty
confident, Wilson."</p>

<p>"I can't lose," I said.</p>

<p>"No? Frankly I don't see how you
can win."</p>

<p>I smiled. "Without mentioning any
names, Joseph, I feel confident that
the final outcome of this racing contest
will be just as you want it to be.
I shall ask that no credit be given me,
although I shall be greatly admired
by our mutual friend Miss Nora
Taylor who will think that I am truly
wonderful for making you happy.
And it is more than likely that she
may marry me once I have shown you,
and she, <i>and</i> Lieutenant Delancey,
that I am a law-abiding citizen as
well as a man who values friendship
enough to do as his old pal Joe Barcelona
desires."</p>

<p>"It's going to be one of the neatest
tricks of the week," he said.</p>

<p>"It will be done by the proper application
of laws," I said modestly.</p>

<p>Behind us, Gimpy Gordon light-fingered
a half dollar out of Delancey's
pocket and was attracting the
attention of a hot dog peddler by waving
his program. Some folks nearby
were eying Barcelona's noisemakers
angrily but making very little visible
protest once they identified him. Nora
was reading her program and underlining
some horses. The whole place
began to grow into a strange excited
silence as the track board began to
go up. It was to be a nine-horse
race, and at the top of the list were
three&mdash;count them&mdash;three odds-on
favorites:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="toc1">1. Murdoch's Hoard</td><td class="toc2">1:2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="toc1">2. Mewhu's Jet</td><td class="toc2">3:5</td></tr>

<tr><td class="toc1">6. Helen O'Loy</td><td class="toc2">8:1</td></tr>
</table></div>



<p>And then, of course, there were
our three mud turtles which must
have been entered by someone who
thought that the Kentucky Derby was
a claiming race and who hoped that
the LePage's Glue people would make
a bid for the three mounds of thoroughbred
horseflesh that dropped
dead in the backstretch:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="toc1">7. Flying Heels</td><td class="toc2">100:1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="toc1">8. Moonbeam</td><td class="toc2">250:1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="toc1">9. Lady Grace</td><td class="toc2">500:1</td></tr>
</table></div>



<p>The rack hadn't hit the top of the
slide before there was a sort of mass-movement
towards the mutuel windows.
The ones who didn't go in
person tried to hurl betting-thoughts
in the hope of getting there early and
failing this they arose and followed
the crowd. Slowly the odds began to
change; the figures on our three platers
began to rise. There was very little
activity on the other six horses. Slow-thinking
Gimpy Gordon started to
get up but I put out a hand to stop
him.</p>

<p>"But the odds are dropping," he
complained.</p>

<p>"Gimpy," I said, "they pay on the
final listing anyway. But would you
like a tip?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said nervously.</p>

<p>"My tip is to keep your cash in
your pocket. Put it on the nose of
some horse and it's likely to get blown
away by a high wind."</p>

<p>The odds were changing rapidly.
What with psionic information receivers,
trend predictors and estimated
anticipators, the mutuel computers
kept up with the physical transfer of
funds, figured out the latest odds, and
flipped the figures as fast as the machinery
could work the dials. In no
more than a few minutes the odds on
the three platers looked more like the
odds on horses that stood a chance of
winning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Barcelona looked at me. "What did
you do, wise guy?"</p>

<p>"Who ... me? Why, I didn't do
anything that you did not start&mdash;except
that maybe I was a little more
generous."</p>

<p>"<i>Spiel!</i>" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Why, shucks, Joseph. All I did
was to slip good old Gimpy Gordon
a tip."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Just a lousy little thousand dollar
bill."</p>

<p>"A grand! For what, wise guy?"</p>

<p>"Why, just for telling me what
horses you picked for the Derby."</p>

<p>Barcelona looked at the odds on his
horses. Flying Heels had passed even
money and was heading for a one-to-two
odds-on. The other platers were
following accordingly.</p>

<p>"And what did you tell Gimpy,
Wilson?"</p>

<p>"You tell him, Gimp," I said.</p>

<p>"Why, Wilson just said that we
should ride along with you, Mr. Barcelona,
because you are such a nice
guy that everybody works awfully
hard to see that you get what you
want."</p>

<p>"There's more!" roared Barcelona.</p>

<p>"Only that I shouldn't mention it
to anybody, and that I shouldn't place
my bet until the mutuel windows
open because if I did it would louse
up the odds and make you unhappy."
Gimpy looked at Barcelona's stormy
face and he grew frightened. "Honest,
Mr. Barcelona, I didn't say a word
to nobody. Not a word." He turned
to me and whined plaintively, "You
tell him, Mr. Wilson. I didn't say a
word."</p>

<p>I soothed him. "We know you
didn't, Gimpy."</p>

<p>Barcelona exploded. "Ye Gods!"
he howled. "They used that gimmick
on me when I lost my first baby tooth.
'Don't put your tongue in the vacant
place,' they said, 'and don't think of
the words <i>Gold Tooth</i> and it'll grow
in natural gold!'"</p>

<p>As he spoke the odds on Flying
Heels changed from a staggering
One-to-Eight to an even more staggering
One-to-Ten. That meant that anybody
holding less than a ten-dollar
bet on such a winner would only get
his own money back because the track
does not insult its clients by weighing
them down with coins in the form of
small change. They keep the change
and call it "Breakage" for any
amount over an even-dollar money.</p>

<p>Delancey said to Barcelona, "You
have had it, Joseph."</p>

<p>Barcelona snarled, "Put the big arm
on Wilson here. He's the fast man
with the big fix."</p>

<p>"Wilson didn't fix any race,
Joseph. He just parlayed some of the
laws of human nature into a win for
himself and a lose for you."</p>

<p>"Now see here&mdash;what's this guff
about human nature?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's the human desire to
ride with a winner, and the human
frailty that hopes to get something
for nothing. To say nothing of the
great human desire to be 'On the Inside'
track or 'In the Know' so that
they can bet on the 'Sure Thing'. And
so," said Delancey, "we've about
twenty thousand human beings full of
human nature holding tickets on your
three dogs, Joseph. They bet their
money because the 'Inside Dope' said
that the big fix was in. And I can
tell you that what twenty thousand
people are going to do to this 'Inside
Dope' when their nags run last is going
to make Torquemada ask permission
to return to life for a Second
Inquisition, this time with extrasensory
tortures." He turned to me as
Barcelona went pale. "Wally," he
asked, "want to bet that someone
doesn't remember that old question of
whether it is possible to break every
bone in a man's body without killing
him?"</p>

<p>"I'd be a fool to cover that one," I
said. "But I'll play even money and
on either side of whether Joseph dies
or lives through the process."</p>

<p>"Stop it!" screamed Barcelona. He
grabbed me by the arm. "Wilson," he
pleaded, "Can you? Stop it, I mean?
Can you fix it?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said.</p>

<p>"Legally?"</p>

<p>"Yep. But it'll cost you."</p>

<p>"Just money?"</p>

<p>"Just money&mdash;and admitting that
you lost, Joseph!"</p>

<p>"I lose," he said. "Go ahead!"</p>

<p>"O.K., Joseph. Now, let's be real
honest. Those three longshore turtles
belong to you, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And right now you wouldn't even
want to see them run, would you?
In fact, you really want that they
shouldn't run."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right, Joseph. Call off your
noisemakers and toss the Head Steward
a thought. Tell him you're scratching
your entries."</p>

<p>"But that won't stop the people
from losing their money."</p>

<p>"Natch. So next you broadcast a
thought that because of this terrible,
grievous error you are refunding their
money out of your own pocket since
the Track Association will not or is
not obliged to."</p>

<p>He turned to his pair of rattleheads
and snarled, "All right. Shut up!"</p>

<p>A mental silence fell that was like
the peace of rest after a busy day. As
Barcelona was tossing his cancellation
at the Steward and preparing to
make a full and plausible explanation
to the gambling instinct of the Kentucky
Derby crowd, I considered the
matter carefully:</p>

<p>"Let's see," I thought. "He wants
'em not to run and so he can't complain
to me if they do not. I didn't
fix the race, so Lieutenant Delancey
can't accuse me of that. That makes
everybody happy, and I win!"</p>

<p>A small hand stole into mine.
"How about me, Wally?" Nora asked
sweetly.</p>

<p>I looked down at a thionite dream
come true by the glow in her eyes
that admired no one else but me.
"You're mine," I reminded her, "until
Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and
Lady Grace win One, Two, and
Three at the Kentucky Derby."</p>

<p>"Or," she said mischievously,
"'Til death do us part!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I was instructing her how to respond
to a kiss as a lady should
respond when about two hundred
thousand noisy, exuberant human
natures yelled and radiated and
thought: "They're Off!"</p>

<p>But they didn't mean us. They
were watching a bunch of long-faced
hayburners chasing one another
around a dusty track.</p>

<p>Human nature ain't changed a bit.
It's just more complicated in an
extrasensory sort of way.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
